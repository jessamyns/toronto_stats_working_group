# Toronto Stats Working Group


## General Info

## Level

Everyone is welcome! 

Meg and I have been talking about scheduling a regular meeting time next semester to discuss/work through Gelman and Hill's 2006 book Data Analysis Using Regression and Hierarchical Models (http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/), which covers design and implementation of regression models. The specific format of the group is to be determined, depending in part on the preferences of those involved, but will include reading, discussion, and working through examples together. Faculty, grad students, and postdocs are all welcome.
